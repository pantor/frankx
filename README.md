Frankx is a high-level motion library (both C++ and Python) for the Franka Emika Panda robot. It adds a Python wrapper around [libfranka](https://frankaemika.github.io/docs/libfranka.html), while replacing necessary real-time programming with higher-level motion commands. As frankx focuses on making real-time trajectory generation easy, it allows the robot to react to unforeseen events.

## Installation

For using frankx with Python, you can start by
```bash
pip install frankx
```

Frankx is based on [libfranka](https://github.com/frankaemika/libfranka), [Eigen](https://eigen.tuxfamily.org) for transformation calculations and [pybind11](https://github.com/pybind/pybind11) for the Python bindings. Frankx implements its own Online Trajectory Generator (OTG), but you can optionally use the battle-tested [Reflexxes](http://reflexxes.ws) library. As the Franka is quite sensitive to acceleration discontinuities, make sure to use *Reflexxes Type IV*. After installing the dependencies (the exact versions can be found below), you can build and install frankx via

```bash
mkdir -p build
cd build
cmake -DBUILD_TYPE=Release ..
make
make install
```

If you want to use Reflexxes, make sure that it can be found by CMake by setting the `Reflexxes_ROOT_DIR`and `REFLEXXES_TYPE` argument:
```bash
cmake -DBUILD_TYPE=Release -DReflexxes_ROOT_DIR=../libs/RMLTypeIV -DREFLEXXES_TYPE=ReflexxesTypeIV ..
```

To use frankx, you can also include it as a subproject in your parent CMake via `add_subdirectory(frankx)` and then `target_link_libraries(<target> libfrankx)`. Make sure that the built library can be found from Python by adapting your Python Path.


## Tutorial

Frankx comes with both a C++ and Python API that differ only regarding real-time capability. We will introduce both languages next to each other. In your C++ project, just include `include <frankx/frankx.hpp>` and link the library. For Python, just `import frankx`. As a first example, only four lines of code are needed for simple robotic motions.

```.cpp
#include <frankx/frankx.hpp>
using namespace frankx;

// Connect to the robot with the FCI IP address
Robot robot("172.16.0.2");

// Reduce velocity and acceleration of the robot
robot.setDynamicRel(0.05);

// Move the end-effector 20cm in positive x-direction
auto motion = LinearRelativeMotion(Affine(0.2, 0.0, 0.0));

// Finally move the robot
robot.move(motion);
```

The corresponding program in Python is
```.py
from frankx import Affine, LinearRelativeMotion, Robot

robot = Robot("172.16.0.2")
robot.set_dynamic_rel(0.05)

motion = LinearRelativeMotion(Affine(0.2, 0.0, 0.0))
robot.move(motion)
```

Furthermore, we will introduce methods for geometric calculations, for moving the robot according to different motion types, how to implement real-time reactions and changing waypoints in real time as well as controlling the gripper.


### Geometry

`frankx::Affine` is a thin wrapper around [Eigen::Affine3d](https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/dox/group__TutorialGeometry.html). It is used for Cartesian poses, frames and transformation. Frankx simplifies the usage of Euler angles (default ZYX-convention).
```.cpp
// Initiliaze a transformation with an (x, y, z, a=0.0, b=0.0, c=0.0) translation
Affine z_translation = Affine(0.0, 0.0, 0.5);

// Define a rotation transformation using the (x, y, z, a, b, c) parameter list
Affine z_rotation = Affine(0.0, 0.0, 0.0, M_PI / 3, 0.0, 0.0);

// Make use of the wonderful Eigen library
auto combined_transformation = z_translation * z_rotation;

// Get the Euler angles (a, b, c) in a vector representation
Eigen::Vector3d euler_angles = combined_transformation.angles();

// Get the vector representation (x, y, z, a, b, c) of an affine transformation
frankx::Vector6d pose = combined_transformation.vector();
```

In all cases, distances are in [m] and rotations in [rad]. Additionally, there are several helper functions for conversion between Eigen and libfranka's std::array objects. In python, this translates into
```.py
z_translation = Affine(0.0, 0.0, 0.5)
z_rotation = Affine(0.0, 0.0, 0.0, math.pi / 3, 0.0, 0.0)
combined_transformation = z_translation * z_rotation

# These two are now numpy arrays
euler_angles = combined_transformation.angles()
pose = combined_transformation.vector()
```

As the trajectory generation works in the Euler space, please make sure to have continuous Euler angles around your working point. You can adapt this by setting the flange to end-effector transformation via `setEE(...)`.


### Robot

We wrapped most of the libfanka API (including the RobotState or ErrorMessage) for Python. Moreover, we added methods to adapt the dynamics of the robot for all motions. The `rel` name denotes that this a factor of the maximum constraints of the Panda robot.
```.py
robot = Robot("172.16.0.2")

# Recover from errors
robot.recover_from_errors()

# Set velocity, acceleration and jerk to 5% of the maximum
robot.set_dynamic_rel(0.05)

# Alternatively, you can define each constraint individually
robot.velocity_rel = 0.2
robot.acceleration_rel = 0.1
robot.jerk_rel = 0.01
```


### Motion Types

Frankx defines five different motion types. In python, you can use them as follows:
```.py
# A point-to-point motion in the joint space
m1 = JointMotion([-1.81194, 1.17910, 1.75710, -2.1416, -1.14336, 1.63304, -0.43217])

# A linear motion in cartesian space
m2 = LinearMotion(Affine(0.2, -0.4, 0.3, math.pi / 2, 0.0, 0.0))
m3 = LinearMotion(Affine(0.2, -0.4, 0.3, math.pi / 2, 0.0, 0.0), elbow=1.7)  # With target elbow angle

# A linear motion in cartesian space relative to the initial position
m4 = LinearRelativeMotion(Affine(0.0, 0.1, 0.0))

# A more complex motion by defining multiple waypoints
m5 = WaypointMotion([
  Waypoint(Affine(0.2, -0.4, 0.2, 0.3, 0.2, 0.1)),
  # The following waypoint is relative to the prior one
  Waypoint(Affine(0.0, 0.1, 0.0, Waypoint.ReferenceType.Relative))
])

# Hold the position for [s]
m6 = PositionHold(5.0)
```

The real robot can be moved by applying a motion to the robot using `move`:
```.py
robot.move(m1)
robot.move(m2)

# To use a given frame relative to the end effector
camera_frame = Affine(0.1, 0.0, 0.1)
robot.move(camera_frame, m3)

# To change the dynamics of the motion, use MotionData
data = MotionData(0.2)  # Using a dynamic_rel of 0.2 (eventually multiplied with robot.dynamic_rel)
robot.move(m4, data)
```

Using MotionData, you can adapt the dynamics (velocity, acceleration and jerk) of a specific motion.
```.py
data.velocity_rel = 1.0
data.jerk_rel = 0.2
```


### Real-Time Reactions

By adding reactions to the motion data, the robot can react to unforeseen events. In the Python API, you can define conditions by using a comparison between a robot's value and a given threshold. If the threshold is exceeded, the reaction fires. Following comparisons are currently implemented
```.py
reaction_motion = LinearRelativeMotion(Affine(0.0, 0.0, 0.01))  # Move up for 1cm

# Stop motion if the overall force is greater than 30N
d1 = MotionData().with_reaction(Reaction(Measure.ForceXYZNorm() > 30.0))

# Apply reaction motion if the force in negative z-direction is greater than 10N
d2 = MotionData().with_reaction(Reaction(Measure.ForceZ() < -10.0), reaction_motion)

# Stop motion if its duration is above 30s
d3 = MotionData().with_reaction(Reaction(Measure.Time() >= 30.0))

robot.move(m2, d2)

# Check if the reaction was triggered
if d2.has_fired:
  robot.recover_from_errors()
  print('Force exceeded 10N!')
```

Once a reaction has fired, it will be neglected furthermore. In C++ you can additionally use lambdas to define more complex behaviours:
```.cpp
// Stop motion if force is over 10N
auto data = MotionData()
  .withReaction({
    Measure::ForceXYZNorm() > 10.0  // [N]
  })
  .withReaction({
    [](const franka::RobotState& state, double time) {
      return (state.current_errors.self_collision_avoidance_violation);
    }
  });

// Hold position for 5s
robot.move(PositionHold(5.0), data); // [s]
// e.g. combined with a PositionHold, the robot continues its program after pushing the end effector.
```


### Real-Time Waypoint Motion

While the robot moves in a background thread, you can change the waypoints in real-time.
```.cpp
robot.moveAsync(motion_hold);

// Wait for key input from user
std::cin.get();

motion_hold.setNextWaypoint(Waypoint(Affine(0.0, 0.0, 0.1), Waypoint::ReferenceType::Relative);
```


### Gripper

In the `frankx::Gripper` class, the default gripper force and gripper speed can be set. Then, additionally to the libfranka commands, the following helper methods can be used:

```.cpp
auto gripper = Gripper("172.16.0.2");

// These are the default values
gripper.gripper_speed = 0.02; // [m/s]
gripper.gripper_force = 20.0; // [N]

// Preshape gripper before grasp, use the given speed
gripper.move(50.0); // [mm]

// Grasp an object of unknown width
is_grasping = gripper.clamp();

// Do something
is_grasping &= gripper.isGrasping();

// Release an object and move to a given distance
if (is_grasping) {
  gripper.release(50.0);
}
```

The Python API should be very straight-forward for the Gripper class.
